This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin version specified in your project's `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file and the version required by Expo Go.  The error message might not be directly pointing to this mismatch, but instead show a more general build failure, often related to dependencies or missing tools.
