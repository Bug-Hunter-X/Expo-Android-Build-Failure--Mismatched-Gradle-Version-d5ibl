The solution lies in updating the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file to use a Gradle version compatible with Expo Go.  Specifically, find `distributionUrl` within `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` and replace it with the correct URL for a compatible Gradle version.  Consult the official Expo documentation for the latest recommended version. You might need to synchronize versions in `android/app/build.gradle` as well.  This version alignment ensures that the build process uses a consistent and supported Gradle version, thereby resolving the conflicts and allowing a successful build.  Also, ensure to clean the project before rebuilding: `expo prebuild --clean` and then `expo build:android`.
